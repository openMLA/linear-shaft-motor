# Linear shaft motor stage üß≤

![](preview.jpg)

Hardware design of a Linear Induction Motor. Uses circumferential coil arrangement (a.k.a. 'linear shaft motor'). The design is intended to be used as an  'XY-stage' for a lithography machine or other applications with precision position requirements but light load.

Target features

* ~1 Micron position (measurement) accuracy or better
* Ability to stack design for two linear movement axes
* ~110mm travel range
* Open Hardware. Designed from parts that can be sourced.

### Hardware overview üõç

There are 3 elements that are key to a linear induction stage. Considerations and selection motivations can be found on the linked wiki sections.

* [Linear guidance system](https://github.com/openMLA/linear-shaft-motor/wiki/linear-guidance) ‚öô. The mechanical constraints that constrain motion along a single direction. Think linear rails and so on. 
* [Linear induction motor](https://github.com/openMLA/linear-shaft-motor/wiki/induction-motor) üß≤. The magnets and coil assembly that are able to produce the forces required for the stage to move along it's constrained motion path.
* [Encoder and feedback circuit](https://github.com/openMLA/linear-shaft-motor/wiki/encoder-and-feedback) üíª. Components that sense the system's position and use this information to drive the linear motor to target location.

Of course there is also the brackets and mounting surfaces that are required to ensure these pieces all fit together.

### Linear induction motor geometries üî†

There are 3 categories of linear induction motors:

* Flat motors (flat magnets only on one side of forcer) 
* I-beam motors (flat magnets on both sides of forcer)
* Shaft motors (cylindrical magnets with forcer wrapped around magnets)

There are advantages and disadvantages to each geometry. This [video  by  WSM Technology INC üé•](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bxs2PFg0luw) is a good starting point. It primarily is listing advantages of Shaft motors (as used in this project), but doesn't really go into the downsides of the shaft geometry. I think that the primary disadvantage is that the shaft motor is a pretty bulky design, and in space-constrained applications it may not be ideal. This kind of project would actually be a good fit for flat or I-beam geometries as the space below the stage is quite wide, and a linear-shaft design is not using that space efficiently.

Besides the many commercial vendors of induction motors of the various kinds (shaft, flat, and I-beam), there have also been various DIY attempts at such motors. They are impressive efforts, and were very effective in demonstrating the feasibility of the concept. Vulcaman's project can and has even been reproduced by another user.
