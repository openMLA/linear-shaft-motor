# Linear shaft motor 🧲
Hardware design of a Linear Induction Motor. Uses circumferential coil arrangement (a.k.a. 'linear shaft motor'). 

### Selected Hardware

* 🍢 Carbon fiber shaft holding magnets. Needed stiff material with low magnetism. Alu or Brass would also work just fine I guess, but this is better and available.
* 🧲 Magnets: Neodymium
* 🔌 Coils: sourced from JHcoils?
* 🧰 Linear guidance: ideally.
* ⚡ Driving: TMC4671 and TMC6200 (Or 6100)
* 🎯 Encoder: Magnetic  or optical?

### Linear induction motor geometries

There are 3 categories of linear induction motors:

* Flat motors (flat magnets only on one side of forcer) 
* I-beam motors (flat magnets on both sides of forcer)
* Shaft motors (cylindrical magnets with forcer wrapped around magnets)

There are advantages and disadvantages to each geometry. This [video  by  WSM Technology INC 🎥](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bxs2PFg0luw) is a good starting point. It primarily is listing advantages of Shaft motors (as used in this project), but doesn't really go into the downsides of the shaft geometry. I think that the primary disadvantage is that the shaft motor is a pretty bulky design, and in space-constrained applications it may not be ideal.

### Similar projects 👨‍❤️‍👨

Besides the many commercial vendors of induction motors of the various kinds (shaft, flat, and I-beam), there have also been various DIY attempts at such motors. They are impressive efforts, and were very effective in demonstrating the feasibility of the concept. Vulcaman's project can and has even been reproduced by another user.
